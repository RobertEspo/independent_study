Armstrong reviews to date (2014) the tonal inventory of Peninsular Spanish (PS) in the AM framework, focusing on three varieties: Castilian, Cantabrian, and Jerez Andalusian. She identifies their typical labelling conventions and calls for more information on the phonological aspects of the phonetic phenomenon to create unification in labelling across works. She compares the tonal inventory of PS to that of European Portuguese (EP). Although there is overlap in phonetic and phonological values, the pitch accents very often map onto different pragmatic values in each language, and they can also change across variety in each language.
